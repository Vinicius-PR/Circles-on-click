# Circles on Click

This is a simple exercise for beginners. It can be a test that recruiters may do with those who apply for junior jobs.

## Explanation

The goal of this exercise is to create a circle where the user clicks. Also, it must have two buttons. One for **Undo** and other for **Redo**. In addition, I put two inputs. One to change the size of the circle and the other to change the color of it.

To do it, I used the main concepts of React, that are State and Immutability.

## Technolages used
* ReactJs
* CSS
* HTML
* TypeScript
* JavaScript

## How can I use it?

### First
Check if you have the node and npm (comes with node) installed in your machine. To check, you must go to your terminal or command prompt and type:
> node -v

> npm -v

If shows the version, you are good to go. If not, go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and install the LTS version (it will install both node and npm).

### Second

If you don't have an IDE, install one of you preference. In my case, I used Visual Studio Code.

### Third

You clone the project. Use the commande line on your folder:
 > git clone https://github.com/Vinicius-PR/Circles-on-click.git
 
 ### Fourth
 
Open the folder using your IDE. Then, go to the terminal of your IDE and type the following command to install the dependencies: (or can go to the folder application using normal terminal and type the same command)
 > npm install
 
 ### Finally
 
To run the project, run the command:
 > npm run dev
